# libcommunism
libcommunism is a simple cooperative multithreading library. It implements the concept of CoThreads, which are lightweight streams of execution context switched in user space. Each CoThread has its own stack, which allows them to maintain implicit state between invocations. Control is passed cooperatively between threads, rather than preemptively as kernel threads are scheduled, hence the name.

The library has no external dependencies, besides a C++20 compiler and CMake 3.21. (Earlier versions of CMake will likely work, but were not tested. C++20 is required for native `std::span` support.)

## Supported Platforms
Due to the nature of the library, some architecture specific code is required. Currently supported architectures and targets are:

- amd64 (System V ABI)

Support for additional platforms is relatively trivial to add.

## Documentation
Documentation on the library can be autogenerated from the sources using Doxygen.

## Tests
Some basic tests are implemented via Catch2 and can be built by setting the `BUILD_LIBCOMMUNISM_TESTS` option in the CMake configuration. Of particular interest may be the `benchmark` tests, which test the context switching speed.
